# Changelog

## 0.2.1-experiment

- The Extruder panel no longer disappears from the dashboard and from Interface Settings when the
  printer is open in a second browser or a second tab. Snapmaker's firmware was answering Mainsail
  out of another tab's cached status, and that cache never holds the printer's configuration, so
  Mainsail found no extruders in it. Mainsail now asks in a way the firmware cannot answer from
  that cache.

## 0.1.3

- AFC panel fix for toolchangers: the lane Eject button now enables only when
  that lane's tool is mounted on the carrier (`laneActive`) instead of on
  filament state (`tool_loaded`). On a toolchanger the upstream behavior greyed
  Eject out exactly when a tool was mounted and loaded. Paired with afc-lite,
  Eject docks (parks) the mounted tool.

## 0.1.2

- Declares its Klipper restart and the restart permission explicitly, matching
  the intent-based install schema.

## 0.1.1

- Configurable HTTP port. Runs on port 81 by default so Fluidd keeps port 80;
  set port 80 to make Mainsail primary and Fluidd shifts to 81 automatically.

## 0.1.0

- First release. Installs Mainsail v2.17.0 as a second web frontend.
